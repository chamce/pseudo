NOTES

How to make Kraft Mac & Cheese:
- Go to a kitchen
    - Look for a stove and sink
    - If the kitchen does not have a stove and a sink, go to a different kitchen
    - Check if the stove and sink work
    - If either the stove or the sink doesnâ€™t work, go to a different kitchen
- Look for the materials
    - Materials: medium sauce pan, cooking spoon, colander, measuring cup, a knife, dish soap, and a sponge
    - If you do not have the materials, go buy materials
    - Clean the dishes with the dish soap, sink, and sponge
    - If you run out of dish soap before the dishes are clean, go buy dish soap
    - If the sponge stops working before the dishes are clean, go buy a new sponge
- Look for the ingredients
    - Ingredients: original Kraft mac & cheese box, butter sticks, and milk
    - If you have the ingredients, check their expiration dates
    - If any ingredients are expired, go buy ingredients
    - If the ingredients are fresh, check that you have 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cups of milk
    - If you do not, go buy ingredients
- Using the measuring cup, sink, and empty sauce pan, pour 6 cups of water into the sauce pan
- Place the sauce pan onto a working burner that is not already occupied or turned on
- Turn the corresponding burner on medium
- Let the water cook until the water is rapidly boiling
- Put the pasta in the boiling water, stir briefly with the cooking spoon, and set a timer for 9 minutes
- Stir the pasta every 2 minutes with the cooking spoon
- When the timer goes off, turn the burner off, and place the sauce pan and colander into the empty sink
- Pour the contents of the sauce pan into the colander over the sink
- Pour the contents of the colander into the empty sauce pan
- Measure 1/4 cups of milk with the measuring cup and pour into the pan
- Measure 4 tablespoons of butter from the butter stick wrapper, cut the butter with your knife, remove the butter from the wrapper, and place the butter into the pan
- Remove the cheese packet from the Kraft box, tear it open, and pour the cheese into the pan
- Stir the pasta until the mixture is uniform
- Serve
